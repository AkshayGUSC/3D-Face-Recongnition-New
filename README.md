# 3D Face Recogntion

## This is a 3D face recognition software. 

Dependencies: python 2, caffe (http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/), numpy, scipy, sklearn <br />
Pre-trained Weight (https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B47nI8lp4t_CTUVxc3Y4b29VR2c/view?usp=sharing) <br />
Input: 3D face of point clouds (.ply format) in Probe and Gallery folder  <br />
Output: Similarities between probe and gallery 


### Step 1. Convert a 3D point cloud (.ply) into 2D depth map (.npy)

Run follwoing command to generate a 2D depth map in ./3DFace/Probe and ./3DFace/Gallery folder
```
python Preprocessing.py
```

### Step 2. Measure similarities between probe and gallery set

Run follwoing command to calculate similarities
```
python Recognition.py
```


# 3D Face Modeling

## This is a 3D face modeling software.
Description
This Window library supports 3D face modeling with the PrimeSense or Kinect 1.0 camera. It supports functions of face modeling. 
There are two supporting versions: (1) Visual Studio 2013 and (2) 2015 Solutions (x64 Release)

Assumptions
The program is for a single user at a time. The person should not stand farther than 1 meter away from the camera or closer than 40 cm to the camera. This version requires "frontal faces" as first input for face modeling, and it can cover pose changes.


## Structure
This package includes 4 main folders:
1.	IRIS3DFacemodeling_cuda8.0\Include_vs2013 or Include_vs2015: 3rd party libraries in Include folder. (e.g) dlib, openCV, OpenMesh 3.2, OpenNI2, pose estimation, pthreads-w23-2-9-1, boost 1.55.0, CUDA 8.0
2. IRIS3DFacemodeling_cuda8.0\dll_vs2013 or dll_vs2015: 3rd party dll files
3. IRIS3DFacemodeling_cuda8.0\src: Face modeling source code.
4. IRIS3DFacemodeling_cuda8.0\model: Face modeling results of OBJ and PLY format.
5. IRIS3DFacemodeling_cuda8.0\Release: Executable file of the project.
